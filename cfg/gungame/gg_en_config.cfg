    // GUNGAME WEAPON ORDER FILE:
    // -------------------------
    // * Set the below variable to the name of the weapon order file that you would like to use.
    // * The weapon order files must be located in the "../cstrike/cfg/gungame/weapon_order/" directory.
    // * You can create custom weapon orders by creating your own "<filename>.txt" and placing it in the above directory.
    // * If you want to change the weapon order file to a different weapon order file while in game, use the command:
    //      gg_setweaponorderfile <filename>.txt
    // * Using the "gg_setweaponorderfile" command will reset the weapon order file and restart the current GunGame match.
    // * If an invalid weapon order file is chosen, GunGame will attempt to open the "default_weapon_order.txt"
    // * In the event that an invalid weapon order file is chosen and GunGame is unable to open the "default_weapon_order.txt",
    //      GunGame will be unloaded, and you will see error messages from GunGame in your console and server logs
    // * The default for this variable is "default_weapon_order.txt" without the ""

    // GUNGAME WEAPON ORDER:
    // --------------------
    // * Set the below variable to the order of the weapons as you would like players to level by.
    // * There are 3 options for the weapon order:
    //      #default    // This will run the weapons in the order (from top to bottom) in the weapon order file
    //      #reversed   // This will reverse the weapon order (from bottom to top) in the weapon order file
    //      #random     // This will randomize the weapon order from the weapons listed in the weapon order file
    // * For more information on the weapon order, see the file "../cstrike/cfg/gungame/weapon_order/default_weapon_order.txt"
    // * You can feel free to edit or modify the default weapon order as supplied, but please keep in mind that if you
    //      download an update, the "../cstrike/cfg/gungame/weapon_order/default_weapon_order.txt" may be overwritten, and you
    //      may need to re-edit the weapon order. It is suggested that you keep a backup of this file
    // * If you want to change the weapon order to a different weapon order while in game, use the command:
    //      gg_setweapons #default
    //      gg_setweapons #reversed
    //      gg_setweapons #random
    // * Using the "gg_setweapons" command will reset the weapon order and restart the current GunGame match
    // * If the incorrect argument is chosen (an argument that is not "#default", "#reversed", or "#random"), GunGame will
    //      ignore the invalid command and you will see error messages from GunGame in your console and server logs
    // * The default for this variable is "#default" without the ""
